# CONFIGS
This is the most basic .vimrc you could have that works for both c files and Makefiles.
Do this !!!!!!!!!!:

 1 -Installation requires Git and triggers git clone for each configured repository to ~/.vim/bundle/ by default. Curl is required for search.

Set up Vundle:

 2 - git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

 3 - launch vim and do : :PluginInstall to install plugins


# CLANG-FORMAT

 my vimrc contains a plugin that automatically clang-formats your .c files
 you should copy Clang/.clang-format to $HOME to have it work correctly




 ENJOY!!!
